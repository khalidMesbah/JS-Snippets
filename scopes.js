/* 
+ global scope
- Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope
- Variables which are declared without the let or const keywords are automatically created in the global scope.  
- Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters,
have local scope. That means they are only visible within that function.
- It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name.
When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.
